		<h1>Our Idea</h1>


		<h3>Goal</h3>
		
		<p>Our goal with StudyBuddy is to make the process of arranging effective group study sessions effortless and encourage students to participate in group studies. We want to see students collaborating with one another.</p>
		
		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<p>Because we think that if done in a certain way, group studying can be very effective way of learning. We think collaboration among students ignites creativity and new ideas. Please view the <a href = "http://www.ted.com/talks/howard_rheingold_on_collaboration.html" target="_blank">Power of collaboration</a> Ted Talk if you want to find out more.</p> 
		<p>Moreover, we think are lots of complications in arranging an effective group study sessions. These complications might even discourage students to not take the initiative of studying in groups.</p>

		<h3>What might be those complications?</h3>
	<ul>
		<b><li>Scheduling Problems</li></b>
		<p>It is difficult to find a common time between more than two students. Reaching out to more than one person to arrange a common time can take a lot of time and effort.</p>
		<b><li>Mutuality</li></b>
		<p>The best study sessions are when students in the groups have similar goals. There might be situations where you only need to solve one more problem in the problem set, whereas your friends have not started the homework yet. This applies not only in problem sets, but other assignments as well.</p>
		<b><li>No existing friends in the class</li></b>
		<p>Students are more likely to study in groups if they already have friends in the class. However, there might be situations where you might not know your classmates. In that situation, it might be difficult to reach out to a “stranger”(not necessarily, you'll go to the same school).</p>
	</ul>

		<li>Helps with Procrastination</li>
		<li>Understand/Absorb Information More Efficiently</li>
		<li>Different Perspectives</li>
		<li>Improve/Develop New Study Skills</li>
		<li>Positive Social Aspect</li>
		<li>Minimizes Test Anxiety</li>
		<li>Enhance your personal/professional skills</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>How is StudyBuddy different from other mediums of forming group study?</h3>
	<ul>
		<b><li>Texting, emailing, Facebook message and in-person</li></b>
		<p>Scheduling needs to be done by continious communication. The back and forth involved might take a lot of time and effort, especially if you are trying to arrage group study with more than one friend. In StudyBuddy you will be able to arrange group study without putting in a lot of effort in communicating with your friends.</p>
		<p>Also, you need have your classmate's number, be Facebook friends or know the person to extend an invitation, whereas in StudyBuddy you can invite all of your classmates that have registered in the website.</p>
		<p>Finally, it's hard to select the right audience with these methods. If a classmate is your Facebook friend or you have their number/email doesn’t necessarily mean that he/she wants to study in groups. However, students that register for StudyBuddy are those that would be interested in studying in groups.</p>
		<p>So, using Study Buddy is an easier way to reach out to classmates that are interested in studying in groups. It's a much easier process than trial and error that we experience with texting, emailing and even in-person.</p>
		<b><li>Facebook Events</li></b>
		<p>Creating Facebook event for your session is a good idea, however, it only works if you are Facebook friends with your classmates. Moreover, there is no way to figure out if the friends that you invited are free/willing to study at that date and time. Whearas, in StudyBuddy, if you update your timing preferences, we will recommend you times that are most likely going to work with your classmates. So, StudyBuddy is an easier way to reachout to your classmates as well as easily figure out what timings might work best for all of you</p>
		<b><li>LATTE Forum Posts</li></b>
		<p>Usually LATTE forum posts goes out to everybody in class through emails. So, it inherits all the complication mentioned in the first bullet point. Moreover, nobody wants extra emails these days.</p>
	</ul>

	<h3>Please tell us what you think about our idea!</h3>
		<p>We have spent a lot of time and effort in creating this application. We also have assumed many hypotheses to be true, which might not necessarily be the case in reality. So, we need your opinion to determine if this idea has potential.</p>
		<p> Please help us test those assumptions by filling out this survey. If you don't want to spend too much time in filling out the survey, you can always drop us a line in the <%=link_to "Contact Us", new_get_in_touch_path %> page.</p>
